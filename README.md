# GRIMREAP - Educational Phishing Simulation Toolkit

A simple, all-in-one tool for cybersecurity awareness training. Simulate credential‑harvesting attacks with 33 realistic login pages, live visitor tracking, and an integrated spear‑phishing email sender - all from a single terminal menu.

**Everything is local and self‑contained.** No APIs to sign up for, no binaries to hunt down. The script even downloads the Cloudflare tunnel for you if it's missing.

---

## Features

- **33 phishing page templates** - Instagram, Facebook, Google, Netflix, PayPal, Steam, and many more.
- **Three tunnel options** - Cloudflare, Ngrok, or plain localhost. Cloudflare's binary is fetched automatically.
- **Live visitor intel** - IP, city, region, country, ISP, organisation, and whether it's a VPN or hosting datacenter.
- **Device detection** - iPhone, Android, Windows, macOS, Linux spotted from the browser's User‑Agent.
- **Real-time credential capture** - Usernames and passwords appear the moment they are submitted.
- **Spear-phishing email crafter** - Send HTML emails through Gmail, Outlook, Yahoo, or any SMTP server.
- Four built-in templates (password reset, security alert, shared document, invoice (the Templates were ai generated so might not be so good)).
- All emails carry a visible **EDUCATIONAL DEMONSTRATION ONLY** banner.
- **Session summary** - Runtime, unique visitors, and total captured credentials.

---

## Requirements

- **php** - for the fake login server.
- **curl** - for geolocation lookups and email sending.
- **python3** - used to parse JSON from the IP info service.
- **(Optional) ngrok** - if using the ngrok tunnel method.

No cloudflared binary needed — it will be downloaded on first use.

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Sks6452/GrimReap
cd Grimreap
bash Grimreap.sh
```

That's it. The only file you need to run is `Grimreap.sh`.

---

## Usage

Run:

```bash
bash Grimreap.sh
```

From the main menu, pick a phishing page (e.g. `01` for Instagram) or `E` for the email crafter.

If you chose a page, select a tunnel method:

1. **Cloudflare** — public URL via Cloudflare's free tunnel.
2. **Ngrok** — public URL via ngrok.
3. **Localhost** — only accessible on your machine.

Copy the displayed URL and send it to your test subject (yourself, a colleague, or a consenting student).

When someone opens the link and enters credentials, you'll see a real-time breakdown in your terminal.

Press `Ctrl+C` to stop the server and view a quick session summary.

## Email Crafter

1. Select `E` from the main menu.
2. Provide your SMTP details.
3. Choose a template.
4. Fill in target details and phishing URL.
5. Send or save a draft.

---

## How It Works

### Phishing Page Mode

- PHP built-in server (`php -S`) hosts the chosen page on `localhost:3333`.
- Tunnel exposes the port publicly.
- Visitors are logged to `ip.txt`.
- Credentials are written to `usernames.txt`.
- Captured credentials are appended to `master_creds.log`.

### Email Crafter Mode

- Generates HTML templates in `templates/`.
- Replaces placeholders like `{{TARGET_NAME}}` and `{{PHISH_LINK}}`.
- Uses `curl` SMTP requests to send mail.
- Success only reported on SMTP `250` response.

## Important Notes

- This tool is for education only.
- Never use it without explicit informed consent.
- Gmail users need 2FA + App Password.
- Cloudflared is downloaded from official releases.

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Fix |
|---|---|
| Cloudflare tunnel fails | Ensure internet access. |
| SMTP test fails | Wrong credentials or wrong port. |
| Emails go to spam | Ask the recipient to check spam. |
| No visitor info shown | IP lookup may fail, credentials still log. |
